# What's all the fuss about?

There's a lot of fuss about TypeScript. You've probably heard about it, and maybe even played with it. People are excited about it, but it just looks like a bunch of junk tacked onto your javascript. What's the big deal?

The [typescript docs ](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/home.html)are fantastic. They do a great job of explaining how to get started writing code. But if you're not convinced, they may not convince you. Or maybe you _are_ convinced, and want to convince your boss or coworkers of the benefits.

This project presents small case studies illustrating the benefit TypeScript gives you. Each one will include:

* a plain JavaScript snippet \(with a bug!\)
* a translation to TypeScript, and an explanation of how our bug could have been prevented
* links to resources to learn more about the TS features used
